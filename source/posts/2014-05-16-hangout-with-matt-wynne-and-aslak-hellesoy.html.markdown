I'd love to hear what you thought about it, and what we can do better next time
&mdash; especially as next time is this Monday, and we'll be joined by [Sandi
Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com) to talk about object-oriented design.

Using the hangout format means that we can include screensharing, code and most
importantly your contributions! Please let us know what you'd like to hear us
discuss.
